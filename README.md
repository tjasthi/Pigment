To build and run this application, the user must open the project in android studio and once the project is made, the user must run the application on an emulator or on an android device.

Once the application is running, the user will go to the device and open the application ‘Pigment.’ The application will open to a diagnostic test to see if the user has any form of red-green colorblindness. Once the test is taken they should be able to see their results on the left fragment of the MainActivity. In this fragment, the user also has the option to retake the test if they think the diagnosis is incorrect.

In the right fragment, the user has the option to take a picture with the camera or upload a photo from the gallery. Once they’ve decided on an image, the user can send this image to be colorized and transformed into a different colorspace.

After the transformation, this image can be customized by using the sliders for saturation, temperature, and contrast. Once the image is customized, the user can save the altered image to their gallery, reset the sliders or head back to the MainActivity to retake the diagnostic test or transform a new image.
